## Description

This is a simple app that creates a game board and alllows the use to play Chess. 
I originally wanted to develop this into a a version of Chess that would be a mini-game
to find the best move during a game and give players a score as to "how accurate" their 
moe was according to something like StockFish(Chess A.I.). Other Projects took up my time
so I decided not to finish this to its complete extent.
